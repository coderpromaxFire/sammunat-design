Most people think creating a startup is the first step.
It’s not.

Clarity always comes before companies.

Before building anything, ask yourself:
• Who is this really for?
• What exact problem does it solve?
• Why does it *need* to exist?

If these answers are blurry, pause.
Learn. Observe. Experiment small.

Strong foundations create strong products.

A website is only a mirror.

If the idea is weak,
the mirror shows it clearly.

Great products start with strong problems —
not fancy interfaces.

Solve the problem first.
Then design the solution.
